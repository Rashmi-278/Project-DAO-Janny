## **Short Description:**
DAO Janny is DAO Proposal Task Manager for Delegates to coordinate on proposal execution for tasks nobody wants to volunatarily do.


## **Long Description:**
DAO Janny is a DAO-native proposal execution board that turns proposals into task cards, assigns them to real contributors/delegates via ENS/EOA address, and verifies execution through attestations, with optional random assignment for low-lift community tasks.
This allows delegates and DAO Members to coordinate on the execution of the proposals. This is necessary because not all proposals can be automatically executed; for example, the DAO constitution update requires follow-up communication and documentation updates.

# TODO:

post on vlayer the task assignment (twitter post) which says:

"I am fullfulling my janitorial duties."

But encrypt it prior with SHA256 hash as an example resulting in the following output on vlayer:

894fa1949d75623601e64adf815153515e5d4d40d9fdebf6a56490110e15b606

Now I proceed to post the official janitorial job on twitter:

"I am fullfulling my janitorial duties."

If anybody in the DAO doubts that it was my work, I can reference the SHA256 hash prior to my tweet!
