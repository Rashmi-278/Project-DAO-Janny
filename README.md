## **Short Description:**
DAO Janny is DAO Proposal Task Manager for Delegates to coordinate on proposal execution for tasks nobody wants to volunatarily do.


## **Long Description:**
DAO Janny is a DAO-native proposal execution board that turns proposals into task cards, assigns them to real contributors/delegates via ENS/EOA address, and verifies execution through attestations, with optional random assignment for low-lift community tasks.
This allows delegates and DAO Members to coordinate on the execution of the proposals. This is necessary because not all proposals can be automatically executed; for example, the DAO constitution update requires follow-up communication and documentation updates.
